<h1 align="center">Coding Dojo Weekly Progress</h1>

In the table below, I'm keeping track of what I am learning from week to week in Coding Dojo. This helps to remind me of how far I have come in my coding journey and to share with others the skills I have acquired.

Week | Skills Learned
------------ | ------------
1 | We covered both HTML and CSS fundamentals. With HTML, we learned about text elements, lists and tables, images and videos, proper indentation, forms, and divs. We also learned how to validate our HTML using https://validator.w3.org/. With CSS, we learned about selectors; modifying colors, text, and size; using Flexbox; CSS resets; and how to use the overflow property to wrap text within a container.
2 | This week, we began our foray into JavaScript.
